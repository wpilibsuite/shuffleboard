# Example Plugin: Custom Data and Widget
This example plugin provides a custom data type and a simple widget for displaying it.

## Building
`./gradlew :example-plugins:custom-data-and-widget:installPlugin` will build a jar file for the plugin and place it
in the Shuffleboard plugins directory `~/Shuffleboard/plugins`. The jar file can be generated with the `jar` task
if you want to build but not install the plugin.
