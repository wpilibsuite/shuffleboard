# Example Plugins
This directory contains several example Shuffleboard plugins that use the Gradle build system using the Kotlin DSL
(rather than the Groovy DSL you may be used to). Each example plugin provides a sample of a certain aspect of the
Shuffleboard API and how to use it.

## Building
Each plugin can be built with the `jar` task; they can be installed with the `installPlugin` task.
