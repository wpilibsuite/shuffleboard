# POWER UP Plugin

This plugin provides widgets for viewing the field state in the 2018 FRC game. This plugin is no
longer bundled with the Shuffleboard app (since the 2018 season and offseason are both over), but
releases will still be made to the WPILib Maven server so it can be used in future offseason events
or on old robots and driverstations.

Releases can be found [here](http://first.wpi.edu/FRC/roborio/maven/release/edu/wpi/first/shuffleboard/plugin/powerup).

To use the releases, download the JAR file for the version you want to use and place it in the `Shuffleboard/plugins`
directory in your user home
